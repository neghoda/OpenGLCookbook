# OpenGL Cookbook 

Basically code from [this](https://github.com/daw42/glslcookbook) repo but with VS Project per example and slightly different formatting and organization.

I found frustrating using command line arguments and cmake, so I repackaged code for my own use. 

## Dependencies
- [glfw](http://glfw.org/)
- [glm](http://glm.g-truc.net/)
